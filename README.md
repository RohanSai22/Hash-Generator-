# Hash Generator Project

A simple and versatile **Hash Generator** tool built with Python that allows you to generate cryptographic hash values. This project is designed for anyone interested in learning about cryptographic hash functions, how they work, and how to implement them.

# This project will implement advanced hashing techniques, including:
# 1. Cryptographic Hashing
# 2. Incremental Hashing (for streaming data)
# 3. Progressive Hashing with modular design
# 4. Salting and Keyed Hash Functions for security
# 5. Advanced Techniques: PBKDF2, bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2, SHA3-512, and Blake2b

You can either run this project directly in **Google Colab** or download the Jupyter notebook and execute it on your local machine.

## Overview

This **Hash Generator** provides a Python-based implementation to generate hash values using multiple hashing algorithms like **MD5**, **SHA-256**, and **SHA-512**. Hash functions are essential in data integrity, security, and cryptography. With this project, you can experiment with different hash algorithms and see how small changes in input can result in completely different hash outputs.

---

## Features

- Generate hash values for various algorithms.
- Easily hash any string or text input.
- Supports **MD5**, **SHA-256**, **SHA-512**, and more.
- A simple and intuitive interface in Google Colab or Jupyter notebook.
